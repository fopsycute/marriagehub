<p>At MARRIAGEHUB.NG, we take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal information when you interact with our website, services, and digital platforms. By accessing or using MARRIAGEHUB.NG, you agree to the practices described in this policy.</p>

<p>When you visit our site or sign up for our services, we may collect personal details such as your name, email address, phone number, and other information that helps us identify you and provide a tailored experience. We may also collect demographic or preference-related data, especially if you choose 
to participate in community discussions, book counselling sessions, or request personalized content. 
Additionally, technical data such as your IP address, browser type, and usage patterns may be collected to help us understand how users interact with our site and to improve our platform’s performance.
</p>
<p>
This information allows us to offer personalized support, respond to inquiries, process transactions, and connect users with licensed counselors or support resources. We also use your data to send helpful newsletters, program updates, and promotional offers—though you can opt out of these communications at any time. Any payment information provided during a transaction is processed through secure third-party providers, and we do not store your card details.
</p>
<p>
In certain cases, we may share your information with trusted service providers who support the operation of our website, such as email platforms, payment processors, or cloud-based tools. We only share what is necessary, and we ensure these providers comply with strong data protection standards. If you choose to book a session with a counsellor, we may pass on limited information to help coordinate your session, but always with discretion and respect for confidentiality. We do not sell or rent your information to any third parties. However, we may disclose information if required by law or as part of a legal process.
</p>

<p>
You have full control over your personal data. You can request access to your information, ask for updates or corrections, delete your account, or opt out of promotional messages at any time by contacting our support team. We also use cookies and similar technologies to enhance your experience, analyse traffic, and deliver relevant content. You can manage cookie preferences in your browser settings.
</p>
<p>
We are committed to protecting your data through security measures such as encryption, access controls, and secure servers. While no system is completely immune to breaches, we continuously monitor and update our security protocols to safeguard your information.
</p>
<p>
<a href="">MARRIAGEHUB.NG</a> may contain links to other websites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy policies or content of those third-party sites. We recommend reviewing their policies before sharing your information on any external platform.
</p>
<p>
Our platform is designed for adults, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of eighteen (18). If we discover that a child has submitted information, we will delete it as soon as possible.
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. When we do, we will revise the effective date and notify users of significant updates. We encourage you to review this policy regularly to stay informed about how your data is handled.
</p>
<p>
If you have any questions or concerns about this policy or the way your personal information is used, please contact us via email at support@marriage.ng or through the contact form on our website.

Your trust matters to us. At MARRIAGEHUB.NG, we are committed to helping you build strong relationships in a safe and respectful digital environment.
